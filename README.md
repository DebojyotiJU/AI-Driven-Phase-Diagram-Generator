# AI-Driven-Phase-Diagram-Generator
A physics-informed ML project that generates synthetic thermodynamic data for binary alloys, computes liquidus/solidus using a solver, and trains a Random Forest surrogate for instant phase-diagram prediction. Includes SHAP explainability, 3D visuals, and a full Colab-ready workflow.
