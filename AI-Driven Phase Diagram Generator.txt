AI-Driven Phase Diagram Generator for Binary Alloys

A physics-informed machine-learning framework that predicts liquidus and solidus behavior for binary alloys using thermodynamic modeling plus surrogate ML prediction.
The dataset is synthetically generated using a regular-solution model (van’t Hoff–based equilibrium), covering wide ranges of melting points, heats of fusion, and interaction parameters.
